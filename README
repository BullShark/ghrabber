A simple tool that downloads all files matching a search specification from
Github. Downloaded files are written to files named user.repository. Existing
files with the same name are skipped, which means that you can reasonably
efficiently stop and resume a ghrab. 


Examples
--------

    ghrabber path:.bash_history

    ghrabber extension:key
